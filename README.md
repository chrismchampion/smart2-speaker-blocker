# Smart^2 Speaker Blocker

## Project Goal
Develop a smart filter to give users more control over speech data sent over the network, ensuring privacy in their home.

## Design

## Implementation

### Resources Used
* Off-the-shelf Mini-ITX PC
* Off-the-shelf external USB microphone and Bluetooth speaker
* Amazon Echo Dot (2nd Generation)
* Open-source software:
  * Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
  * CMU (Carnegie Mellon University) PocketSphinx
  * PyPi SpeechRecognition library
  * Simple Googleâ„¢ TTS (with pico2wave offline speech synthesis back-end)

### Smart^2 Usage Modes
#### Normal operation/keyword evaluation mode
System relays all phrases to Alexa as long as they do not contain sensitive keywords, e.g. finance or security-related keywords. Examples:
> "password", "pin", "pin number", "bank account", "loan"

#### Total privacy mode (voice activated)
No information relayed to Alexa when activated.

#### Time-based keyword mode
No information relayed to Alexa for a predetermined amount of time after keyword/phrase is recognized. Example for use case:
> 1. System recognizes key-phrase "I hate" in spoken sentence "I hate my mother-in-law".
> 2. System immediately stops relaying audio to Alexa for 30 seconds, thus redacting information "my mother-in-law".
> 3. Such information could potentially be stored by Amazon and used for (unwanted) product recommendations, e.g. family therapy self-help book.

#### Argument mode
Privacy mode automatically activated when a preset decibel (dB) value is reached.

## Additional Points
* Hardware vs. software mute buttons: software mute can be bypassed with malware (microphone appears to be deactivated but still sending data in the background).
* Other devices on the market, e.g. Google Home, Facebook Portal, are susceptible to vulnerabilities.
* Privacy Vulnerabilities of Encrypted IoT Traffic.
* Amazon stores recordings of past interactions; must be deleted manually: data collection details a profile of your lifestyle (interesting for marketers and cybercriminals who could obtain access with username/password obtained via security breaches (AWS, FB, etc.).
* Amazon Terms of Service: Amazon can use all captured data.
* Amazon Echo said to have analog hardware mute button that cuts of circuit flow to microphone. LED state tied electrically to the mic (same circuit).
